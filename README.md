# VS Code PHP_CodeSniffer Extension

Integrates [PHP_CodeSniffer](https://github.com/squizlabs/PHP_CodeSniffer) into VS Code.

This extension uses the version of PHPCS defined by the `phpCodeSniffer.executable` setting. Through the use of
custom reports we are able to generate diagnostics, code actions, and document formatting that conforms to
VS Code's feature set.
